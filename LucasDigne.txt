£32m!? For one of the best LB’s around! Try tripling it, and throwing in Gueye and we might just engage in this BS!! 

PSG monitoring another £32 million Everton man apart from Moise Kean https://t.co/Sfc87bsJaz
🚨 According to Le10 Sport: “PSG are said to be monitoring Everton left back, Lucas Digne. PSG are wanting to strengthen their left back position.” #EFC https://t.co/YeTcUQpbKF

First thing .... NO ! Secondly you’re trying to be cheap over the purchase of a fantastic young talent and your highest goal scorer season gone, and thirdly ..... NOOOOOO !!!!
🗞PSG are said to be monitoring Everton’s Lucas Digne. PSG are wanting to strengthen their left back position

👀 PSG are ‘monitering’ #Everton full back Lucas Digne, the French side are looking to strengthen their options in left-back, Theo Hernandez is also on the cards but a deal is said to be ‘very complex’.

Everton transfer rumours: PSG are monitoring another Everton man apart from Moise Kean. Kean could possibly depart but can't see Digne leaving Goodison

@expertanalyst12 @equipedefrance LOL. Not a problem for France.

Lucas Hernandez (Bayern)
Ferland Mendy (Real)
Lucas Digne (Everton)

No worry man.
@ReshadRahman_ Keep but obviously groom another left backs I personally liked Lucas Digne and wouldn’t be opposed to purchasing him back from Everton
🇫🇷 | For the 3rd consecutive season, Lucas Digne is the highest rated left-back in the Premier League on @WhoScored for his performances in the 2020/21 season.

He only cost Everton £18m.💫 https://t.co/euL9RzylKt
For the 3rd season in a row #Everton's Lucas Digne is the best ranked #PremierLeague leftback, based on stats by @WhoScored (min. 1/2 of the games at LB).
@LucasDigne #PL stats: Most clearances, shared most assists, shared most tackles, most aerials won (3,4 per game). https://t.co/SlaCXr23Tp
@littlepolveir @Everton Because Lucas Digne is the best left back in the league, apparently. 🥴🥴
Omnishambles, Everton.

I'd keep Lucas Digne, Ben Godfrey and Jordan Pickford and bin off the rest.

@Everton lucas digne does he ever go forward..shite
Lucas Digne starting today (he was on pre-match media duties) but the question is: how many defenders will be joining him in the XI?

Kyle John has also travelled with the Everton squad today given Seamus Coleman's absence
