Listened to an Everton podcast before and they said something along the lines of "Yerry Mina has certain sections of our fans tricked" nah soft bollocks he's our best defender and some of us can actually see it
@SeanDOlfc fellow everton player Yerry Mina is in the squad btw, not dropped
Buried at the end of this update from @philkecho is a note that Yerry Mina appears to be fit and in training for Colombia. Makes his STILL unexplained absence v. City even more bizarre. Everton's obfuscation on stuff like this only generates rampant speculation. To what end? #EFC https://t.co/bnwxWmNMto

@IceBergHojbjerg @TransferNewsCen So you are claiming digne isnt A bigger name than aurier? He has double the amount of followers online and for the third year running statistically the beet lb in the premier league, yerry Mina more than lloris.
You seem to think spurs players hugely outperform Everton players 😂

I don’t know how you have an Everton team without a fully fit Yerry Mina in. Incredible centre back. If you disagree you know nothing about football. https://t.co/i2SEi8yTe2
@Everton Everton's season to forget @jamesdrodriguez and Yerry Mina total failure. The #19 was The most expensive player of the team, in relation to minutes played. @MrAncelotti to get back on track and look for real reinforcements
@Everton The problems started when you bought Yerry Mina,

You only lack a good CB
Still not having an explanation about Yerry Mina's absence, in the wake of confusing comments about James Rodriguez, really isn't good enough. It's pretty dire communication from Everton.
No Yerry Mina a huge blow for #EFC, but good to see Tom Davies come back into the side.
