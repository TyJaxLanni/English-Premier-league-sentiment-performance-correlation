@rarunasalam @Everton @CalvertLewin14 I fully get your sentiment mate &amp; it's the right way! DCL keep certainly, But if someone bids for Tom Davies, we should sell, he isn't that good, I've watched him many times!

Southampton have reignited their interest in Everton midfielder Tom Davies after failing to lure him last year, Football Insider understands.
@GGenaral5 True , but getting rid of Tom Davies will not bring success to Everton football club . It lies much much deeper then Tom Davies 🤷‍♂️

Southampton plan fresh approach for Everton midfielder Tom Davies - https://t.co/l3YSofnOAZ https://t.co/50hk8IbLey
Southampton interested in Tom Davies apparently. I’m undecided on this one, he’s improved this season and is a useful squad player but not sure he’ll ever be a regular at Everton. Still not sure I’d want to sell him though.
@Everton @CalvertLewin14 I hope we dont sell Tom Davies or DCL as we can and should help these two become sharper and more complete players. The School of Science wasnt' about producing and offloading but about nurturing and growing!

If true, I personally hope the club don’t entertain any offers. Tom may not be the first name on the team sheet but still has something to offer. With some players moving out on a free and with others to shift out the door first, i say he stays for now.

Tom Davies Plays – Everton Team vs Manchester City Confirmed https://t.co/xgZglLjsrL
@TiarnanEFC32 @ryanefc_1878 Not sagging him off, he's a blue and a really nice fucking lad... he's just not good enough...

I want Everton to be winning everything and that's it, if you think Tom Davies is good enough to get us there then I don't know what else to say.
🔵Yerry Mina
🔵Allan
🔵Abdoulaye Doucoure
🔵Tom Davies
🔵Niels Nkounkou

@TikTokInvestors @CryptoWendyO Is this Everton FC midfielder Tom Davies? 🤣🤣🤣
@QuiltyEfc half of “everton twitter” dont even go the game mate proper couch potatos who love slating tom davies sigurdson n pickford
@Jackfaaz @keiranEFC_ “shouts a little bit” do you have a clue what you’re on about. i’ve never actually seen tom davies ever shout neither would i be arsed. and if you think iwobi and holgate should actually be professional footballers you’ve never watched an everton game in your life
@Bluebailey55 The lad that has stolen a living for far to long &amp; you can guarantee that when everton have taken a beating Tom Davies is on the field nice kid &amp; all that but Jesus is this it
@Everton @MrAncelotti Some people might not agree with me but get the paper out and resign Duncan Ferguson on the lifetime deal.
With our former Legend, Tom Davies, and Alex iwobi, we will win the treble!
Nothing personal, but I really hope I never see Tom Davies in an Everton shirt ever ever again.  If he’s the most improved player under ancelotti, think of how bad he was.  Coz he’s still proper shite
@nwblackmon @Everton Tom Davies = City Legend.  Couldn't ask for a better turnover ; )
And people say Tom Davies still has a role to play for us. Here fuck off. The lad is absolute dog shit. #MCIEVE #everton
Sorry to say this but Tom Davies has cost us 3 goals we can’t afford to give the ball@away to a top Man City side in our half @Everton
@Everton When all the fans want are spiteful players with a winning attitude who would do anything possible to spoil Aguero's last appearance, those nice Everton boys do everything possible to oblige within minutes of him coming on

Tom Davies trying to play out under pressure says it all
Tom Davies fans aswell lovely guy not good enough for Everton
What the FUCK are we actually doing trying to play out from the back like we're prime Barcelona?!! Tom Davies getting put on his arse and then Holgate getting rinsed and looking like he doesn't want to be there. It's embarrassing watching this. You're a disgrace @Everton 

#EFC
You are seeing the limits of Tom davies today also,smashing lad, gives everything but if you want Everton to do well and move forwads there's no way he's in the team. That's the truth. Same goes for a lot of positions on the pitch. It's bleak.
No Yerry Mina a huge blow for #EFC, but good to see Tom Davies come back into the side.

@Everton Made up Tom Davies is starting. 👍
Tom Davies Plays – Everton Team vs Manchester City Confirmed https://t.co/a9EPScbAhX #EFC #Everton
If you're looking for any kind of value in the Manchester City v Everton match then I'd slide with Tom Davies (9/2 B365) to be carded.
Seeing City's line up I only see Everton chasing shadows.
Tom Davies inclusion is a real and welcome surprise. 

Can Ancelotti inspire @Everton to a victory against champions @ManCity ?

Let us know your thoughts in the comments below 👇 https://t.co/WMQ1nY2Fhe
Not a bad side tbh. Glad Davies is playing https://t.co/XtUnspWuBU
Coleman has risen and makes the bench. Mina must be on the same plane as James. Tom Davies back in the side 🟠⚫

#UHTPodcast #EFC #COYB #Everton https://t.co/y9XHsEIS1Z
Our selection for today. 5️⃣ at the back and flood the midfield. Can see Sigurdsson being squeezed in somewhere, but would go for Tom Davies personally ⚫🟠⚫

Thoughts blues?
