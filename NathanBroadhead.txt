Everton are preparing to offer Nathan Broadhead a new 2 year deal, with his current deal due to expire end of this month (Liverpool Echo). In my opinion, If we are offering him a deal to send on loan or stay in the U23s, then what is the point of it? https://t.co/1SWdkSVxA7

@greenallefc Everton are ready to offer Nathan Broadhead a new contract. The club are currently in talks with the 36 year old over a new deal with his current contract ending next month. GET RID. IF HE HASNT MADE IT BY NOW, LET HIM GO.
I can't see one valid reason why Everton would offer Nathan Broadhead a new contract, not one.

I'm not knocking the lad he's a really good player with a career ahead of him but this just backs up people's points about the academy structure at Everton.
