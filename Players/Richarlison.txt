@Ben_FPL_ @classycarvalho @CFCDaily LOOOL I was still hungover when I tweeted that, I got mixed up with Everton signing Richarlison. Allow
Ever 4Ever, Ever Everton... Gol de Richarlison
@EM_LFC_ @Corballyred @LFCApproved He did give the ball away v Madrid but *did* track back👇
Also Asensio's shot was going off-target anyway. There were way more 'big' mistakes from other players in that match.
His only 'big' mistake came v Everton when he was ball watching for the Richarlison goal. https://t.co/1rbeMqu25o
@Efc1878toffees @Tilladelphia_ @DoubleA_OTW @Adam0841 @JoshWoogsMusic There's more chance of richarlison locating his hairline than Everton winning a trophy in the next 10 years lol
@FabrizioRomano Why are Everton so open to letting him go? Kean had a great season with PSG and Everton have virtually no depth beneath DCL and Richarlison

@powerhouseSG @BenCakar @sportbible You are saying completely the opposite of what i said. Did Ancelotti inherited a world class squad from their previous manager in Everton? Do you think Having robben, lewandoswki, ribery is same as having calvert lewin, richarlison and rodriguez? Stop kidding yourself man.

@coys100 Can you even do that?😭 

Or pay an inflated fee for one of theirs like Richarlison to Everton?
@Anthonybaquero4 @chrisewjones @LeeALewisLFC @StanCollymore Whilst selling Coutinho for 140m funded Alisson and Fabinho. 

Everton had the chance to cash in on their Brazilian Richarlison to Barcelona for 60m but you rejected it. If you cashed in on Richarlison you could have bought a 60m goalkeeper as well.
Why are Everton fans saying we should sell Richarlison for not producing enough but then suggest we buy players who put up the same or worse numbers than Richarlison last season? Makes 0 sense 😂
@AFC_JoJo @chief_afc Richarlison praised Kante for his performance. No Everton fans cursing  him for that. https://t.co/mEi9W5iDiW
7. Rodriguez ➡️ Richarlison ➡️ Calvert-Lewin (EVE vs WBA, GW2)

Remember how exciting Everton were at the beginning of the season? I love this dinked ball from James, and Richarlison does well with the volleyed assist. 

https://t.co/9dKXTPp9gX
@MightyBluesYT Ffs. Will ppl stop drooling over this clubs recruitment that clubs recruitment. They're a Championship side at best and will be again in 22/23. Everton last 4 seasons. Pickford Richarlison  Godfrey Nkounkou Small Allan Rodriguez DCL Davies Mina Digne Branthwaite etc Not too bad.
12. Everton.

Dominic-Calvert Lewin will have a stunning season and an England call up.

Top assister: Richarlison
Top goalscorer: Dominic-Calvert Lewin
Star player: Ben Godfrey
@BufordTJustice @MatchroomBoxing @TonyBellew @Everton Come on bruv, you have richarlison DCL and king... don't be selfish 🤭🟠
Remember when richarlison lifted the European cup and premier League with Everton? Remember when he was europes best forward with his amazing 7 goals? Remember when he didn't look like a malnourished beaver?

Nah me neither. https://t.co/4Atw7Kxp3u

Richarlison, Calvert Lewin, Allan, Godfrey etc https://t.co/RAtJ9y1Riu
@utd_Lewis nothing will be worse than Everton rejecting £85m for Richarlison 😭
@Hoodmorpheus2 @ArsenalAgitator True and then you had leicester game as well where they broke away and scored and then there was the everton game where richarlison made toast out of him

@cfcxpert_ @utd_Lewis Its okay, we can feel okay about ours because everton rejected 100mil for richarlison from them
Official. Richarlison joins Hannover on a permanent deal from Everton. Here we go since April - now confirmed.

Martin Kind said in an interview:
We are lending Richarlison to the 3rd division for two years so that he can gain match experience. Burning money is fun. https://t.co/SQkQpLDaZF
I have just seen this nice interview from @FabrizioRomano in the Guardian with Marco Silva. 

He is still looking for a role after leaving Everton in December 2019. Maybe one of the English clubs looking for a new manager could consider him! 

https://t.co/nJXYrHhmTs
@WBA OShea would be on list and if the GK hadn’t been called up for England him too but cash in - the Leeds free kick and not headed from Richarlison against Everton and last season at Huddersfield are all the thick brigade need to see - utter utter rubbish
I didn’t care when Firmino liked Richarlison’s post on Everton winning at Anfield and i don’t care either what Mane posts on Insta story or not

If they are performing on the pitch that’s enough for me, their off field activities i have absolutely no interest in
Everton Goal of the Season: 2020-21: https://t.co/ZLoj24PrkA
Bro, even virgil will be dragged if he tried to Like Richarlison's post. People were angry not because it was firmino but because it was fucking Everton and Fucking disgusting Richarlison and to add on to that it was because they injured Thiago and Virg. Even alisson was dragged.
Also because it was fucking everton and fucking richarlison. They ruined our season. Richarlison intentionally injured Thiago and they made fun of it. https://t.co/owJ5F9hw7O

@LivEchoLFC Testament to the team and Klopp for not losing their cool during the match vs Everton. Pickford and Richarlison should have received an elbow or headbutt for their troubles and it would have been justified. Regardless, professional as always Liverpool.
Part of Brazil's "British squad" arrived in Teresopolis, to get ready for the double round of #WorldCup Qualifiers.
#Everton's Richarlison, #Liverpool's Roberto Firmino and #AstonVilla's Douglas Luiz landed on Wed night.

@richarlison97 hey Richarlison I know it must be hard being away from your hometown and family for so long this year but I appreciate all the hard work you did at Everton and next year is going to be awesome.
@ddoublepivot You forgetting the Pepe offside vs Everton amd richarlison goal.

The line was slanted  towards pepe making him offside and also was slanted away from Richarlison in the process getting contact from xhaka...
@SebSB Everton have 5 very good players: DCL, Richarlison, Allan, James and Digne (he’s good enough for France). They played together 7 times in the league. Everton we’re 5-1-1.
@M_OBrien71 Yeah but he was nowhere near the seniors and some felt he shouldn't be near the Everton team. I know it doesn't fit your narrative like, but I think you have to give that one to Carlo.
On the flip side, richarlison seems to be regressing.

WHAT A GOAL RICHARLISON!! | Fifa 21 Everton Career Mode (Ep 5) https://t.co/xkshBqoIy0 via @YouTube
@RichJolly @fourfourtwo
Everton's ECL qualification to midtable mediocracy disaster is a direct result of 
a) Richarlison getting himself sent off v Liverpool
b) tardiness by Gomes and Holgate resulting in at least 9 points going down the pan.
Carlo needs to grip harder 21/22!
@parker_bradley He would be perfect to Everton actually, such a similar player to Richarlison

@_cameronlambert @sportbible @Jonnnyyy21 @ben_brailsford Dias got dribbled past 5 times against Brighton the other week in ONE game, VVD didn’t get dribbled past once in over a year 🤣 he also gave a pen away last day to Everton, VVD would have had that cleared before richarlison could get the ball 🤣
@IceBergHojbjerg @TransferNewsCen Again, the only reason spurs are above Everton is Kane realistically, son is pretty good but when Kane leaves spurs are in a shit state. 
Digne
Godfrey
Allan
Richarlison
Dcl (when Kane goes) 

Would all get in spurs starting 11 as it is now.
@Bhartiya_Kopite Everton deserves shout too. just for those comparisons of Richarlison and Firmino
@MPLS_Toffee Umm what? Everton have spent more than Liverpool since Klopps been here, higher net spend than Liverpool as well. 

Big money on Sigurdsson Richarlison Klassen Pickford Keane Mina Gomes Doucoure Tosun Schniederlin Digne Niasse Walcott etc.
Everton have offered DCL,Godfrey,Pickford,Richarlison and Digne all pathways to international football and that should be used as incentive to future signings to what we can help them achieve
@Hayds_ @TheEvertonEnd @JDGEFC Richarlison plays on the left like Benrahma often does. Fornals plays everywhere. DCL is better than Antonio. Cresswell had a good season but Digne is better overall. West Ham finished above because Everton’s home form was terrible. Congrats. What would be your combined team?
@JDGEFC Even if you don’t want to put Doucoure in ahead of Soucek, that’s still 7 Everton players that walk in. Richarlison still goes in, good job Benrahma and Fornals have been no better

lol yeah he is still young, he can improve, he is the same age as richarlison from everton and i rate richarlison way higher than him https://t.co/LkyWG770BS
My god that is a brazy signing for Everton. DCL, Richarlison and Zaha is a quality front 3 https://t.co/jdBOJP9uSo
FWIW I think somebody like Zaha should be our priority, a quick, direct left footed winger on the opposite side of Richarlison would be great. He’s just the wrong age and price, but since I can barely be arsed watching Everton I don’t know who fits the profile other than Bailey.
Is it true that LFC have made a bid for Richarlison from Everton to replace Steve Carter?  #LFC

@Danny_EFC6 DCL is a good one for any U23 players we sign but his pathway was slower than Godfrey or Richarlison. Digne had already been capped by France before he came too. 

I'm talking about first team buys who can go from nowhere to a full international quickly if they come to Everton.
This is a very good thing for Everton. The club can sell themselves to potential new signings as a clear pathway for young uncapped players to become full internationals. Richarlison for Brazil and Godfrey for England have both made this step within one season of joining. https://t.co/BK3YRT1YPH
@sijv1878 Also, if Spurs are willing pay anything over £40m for him and Everton have one far more rounded and dynamic, aggressive replacement lined up, I'd be accepting that all day. 

Or add that type of player to the squad and get loads for Richarlison.
@sijv1878 People could make Iwobi and Sigurdsson look like Everton legends, when clearly, they are not. 

Same for most players. 

Laughed my head off this morning when I saw someone give Iwobi a 6 for the season and Richarlison a 4! https://t.co/zZLAy8wGGT

@MightyBluesYT Hang on, it was only earlier this season Everton and its players were being called all sorts because of injuries to opposition players, Pickford being accused of murder, Richarlison accused of attempted murder, opposition players admitting they couldn’t sleep properly!
@MattH1878 @Everton_Extra Well it's more than richarlison scored against crap Premier league defenders
@JPickford1 Ha ha I wish you and everton never play in Europe! And tell Richarlison to go back to the ghetto!
@Faaabianskiii We really celebrating finishing a point higher of a frontline of Richarlison, Iwobi and Calvert Lewin to Auba, Laca, Pepe, Saka, Martinelli and Nelson 🤦‍♂️.

Don't get me wrong I think Everton dropped off towards the end but around 8th-10th is where they should be
@Everton Richarlison spinning like a breakdancer for the penalty
What a prick
@AidyDews @Kevin_1878 richarlison getting pulled off by ancelotti crazy times at everton ah🙈
Gentle reminder: 

Everton paid £100m great british pounds for Richarlison and Sigurdsson 🤣
The only way Everton do anything next season is if we fill these blanks 

Pickford

Blank (trippier) 
Godfrey
Blank (koulibally)
Digne

Allan
Doucoure
Blank (Berge)

Richarlison
Blank (zaha) or (coutinho) 

Calvert-lewin
@Livehpool Don't laugh at them. Everton will be the title contender next season with Richarlison scoring 30 goals😭😂😂
@CuthsSt You musnt know Richarlison then m8, that DCL aload of shite aswel. Docoure wow💩💩💩 😂😂😂😂 Coleman too. Havent you seen Lee Catamole in the Center midfield also?? Amean Allan😂😂😂 Everton fc, the peoples club though arent you geezer🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 least you got no1 on the chart

@davidholmes73 @FinKitch Barkley, Stones, fellaini, Lukaku, Richarlison, DCL, baines, coleman were all developed at Everton and the ones that left got ruined
@BigWiIIyMilly @richarlison97 @NapolesThomas Yeap 10 points better than last season. You lot on the other hand 🙃 great progress. So obsessed with Everton you have to stalk richarlison. Sad little murderer
James Rodríguez and Ben Godfrey along with also having Richarlison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin, I really thought that Everton would have been higher up the table and not 10th. Leicester did better than I expected not only finishing 5th but also winning the FA Cup.
@PhilHulme On the pitch though... We can talk for hours. To summarise though, Everton need to focus on using their wealth to buy young talent who want to be there and break through. Sell likes of richarlison and move on.
@Everton @MrAncelotti Evertons biggest problem is believing that richarlison is a world class striker when he is championship level 🤣 Deluded
@ChampagneXabi I remember when Everton tried to chat to the top 4😭 Richarlison can piss off
@EFCli4m imagine him and richarlison on FT at everton https://t.co/er5HfBnNuC
@ianfarrant01 @Everton Parking the bus with 8-1-1 formation. Richarlison in midfield, Calvert Lewin in attacking midfield or just infront with rest of them in defence.
The following should/will not be at Everton next season:

Besic 
Beningime
Walcot 
Tosun
Olsen 
Coleman
Delph
Sigurdsson 
Iwobi
King
Gomes
Bernard 

There is also an argument for James and one from DCL and Richarlison too.

Moshiri's most important transfer window, again...
Richarlison's Everton finished with -1  goal difference
Everton players to keep:

Pickford
Digne
Mina
Godfrey
Allan
Rodriguez
Doucoure
Richarlison
DCL

The rest can all fuck off.

Huge rebuild required this summer, don’t be surprised if Ancelotti jumps ship either.
@pburkhill1701 @Tactical_Times You mean after he came on Vs Everton &amp; was hacked down by Richarlison? Got injured &amp; returned to an absolute shxt show?!
7. Richarlison 4/10
His worst season in an Everton shirt, despite having 16 G/A to his name this campaign. He seemed to struggle without fans. Rise in his score however for the few performances in and around the 5-4 with Spurs when he looked back to his usual self as the sole #9.

@seanrostron @lovelystuff1878 I doubt it but it’d be ‘Everton that’ if James and Richarlison went and we had to bring him back
@Everton Firmino's worst season for #LFC yet still managed more goals (9) than Richarlison (7)

#lfc #efc
@FPLGwladys I do think Everton is a special case in that respect; Goodison can be such a noisy fortress &amp; players like Richarlison really need that
@DanViquerat For Everton he is. I think Richarlison scores goals for PSG just like Kean has. Some players suited to different leagues 🤷‍♂️. Would of played Kean more btw but he had his reasons
Good riddance Everton. Don't want to see a single one of these players Next season besides Godfrey starting and then keep Richarlison, DCL, Allan, Doucoure, Davies, Pickford and James on the bench
@LouieStyles96 @Everton @abdoudoucoure16 One of the only players to end the season with any credit.  Compare him to Holgate, gylfi, Andre, Keane, Richarlison all shite for 6 months.
Who thinks DCL and Richarlison are good enough for Everton? I no longer want to hear.. there young, DCL a blue, they don't get the support, who want's to see new strikers at the club?
Everton end the season in 10th with pretty small xG underperformance. Their squad isn't actually that far off from qualifying for Europe. Richarlison - DCL - Rodriguez is a CL level front 3, Davies - Doucoure is a fun double pivot but they're a bit too chaotic and positionally
Hi Richarlison &amp; Pickford @Everton enjoy those European nights in Woodison. Hopefully, despite your best efforts, VVD &amp; Thiago will show their true class at the highest level, meanwhile you enjoy mid table mediocrity 🖕
Everton finished 10th with - GD. Fuck off richarlison and pickford. Thats where u belong scums.

@Everton Mad that Allardyce took us from 13th to 8th in 6 months, with Walcott, a 33yr old Wayne Rooney and Morgan Schneiderlin. Ancelotti took us from 1st to 10th in 6 months with James Rodriguez &amp; Richarlison
Richarlison 

Wants a move last season....so essentially this was his shop window season.......

Everton is a step up from Watford....has he proven he can step up to Real or Barca? Not in top 25 scorers in Prem! 50m? 

At least he has passion
@Everton *capitulation. 
Bernard, Iwobi, Gomes, Delph need to be sold asap. Richarlison, Holgate need to smarten up. James? God knows what to do with him!
@Everton Richarlison is ridiculously over rated. Has a good game every 7-8 games. Why we turned down £80milliom for him I’ll never know. Holgate is nowhere near good enough. We literally need 7-8 players just to challenge for Europe next season
@oemanuelvargas Everton e com Richarlison
@emmaowen14 @Everton Yer probably need to keep Pickford. Richarlison can go.
@Everton Allan, Godfrey &amp; Richarlison did well today....full stop....need to build around them....

@Everton @hummel1923 Shame we don’t have a team to wear it           Holgate, Keane, Davies, Iwobi, Sigurdsson, Richarlison, DCL ... sell them all and spend the money on better 🙏🏼
Feel sorry for Everton and Richarlison who are finishing 10th 😂😂😂

-the 4 match winning streak to start the season
-Richarlison had that Twitter burn on an LFC fan https://t.co/AFLNnA1cu7
@torturedtoffee @VSFDaniel123 @Everton What failings? Richarlison can't hit a barn door, Davies is shite, our defence is shambolic, we're slow, lethargic, lacking passion, we're shit.
Definitely City &amp; Aguero’s day.

This is the benchmark Everton have to aspire to.

New season purchases must be of the same quality of Richarlison and a clear out the priority for Carlo.

#ManCityvEverton

Boz
@alexbe11 @Everton @MrAncelotti So many managers have struggled to get a tune out of Gylfi, Keane, Gomes etc. that I think we need to deal with the lack of quality to properly judge. The regression of Richarlison has offset the progress of DCL. Worrying.

Today is a shameful end to an underwhelming season
@Everton Sam Allardyce finished 8th with Tosun, Walcott and Niasse But he gets loads of shit and got hounded out the club. We've slipped from 5th to 10th in 10 games with Richarlison, Rodriguez, Allan and co. but everyone loves Carlo. I'm confused. @ToffeeTVEFC @EvertonBlueArmy
Everton spending all that money and blessed with Calvert-Lewin and Richarlison up top only to finish 10th
Martin Tyler with the award for the most ridiculous comment of the season..”no one works harder than #Richarlison I could think of 382 players straight off the top of my head. #Everton #SkySports #football
I swear I can almost expect for #Richarlison to pick up a card every game.

#Everton #ManCity
Iwobi plays in Richarlison but his touch lets him down
https://t.co/NjkAfERt8N
@Everton They Signed Richarlison for23 mill.I cant believe it was only that much but you should sell. Be a huge profit and can get 3 players with his💰Sigs replacement You have Calvert already. Rich strikes me as wanting to join mbappe and neymar at PSG&amp; theyll pay 100 mill they wont care
@BobtheRed1 Everton players know how to keep their fans happy, strike the iron when hot, score the odd goal, throw a shirt to a kid, tweet about liverpool and how u hate them, job done! Richarlison has mastered it! Get away with 30 out of 40 shite performances off that!

I know everton fans are bias as its our team but it's a yellow card and richarlison is as far in the box as walker for the penalty so its not that big of a deal..
@EfcSl Soooo....Richarlison is 23 played for Watford, Pickford is 26 played for Sunderland. 🤷‍♂️
@FA nice to see you give everton a anri everton ref , dias red card? Funny rules state last man fouling an attacker in a goal scoring opportunity is RED not YELLOW card and richarlison pull back is a yellow but KDB does exact same nothinv given what a suprise!! #protectthetop6

Richarlison getting booed for being pole axed for the penalty 👍🏻

#UHTPodcast #EFC #COYB #Everton
I’ve never been arsed that the bellends at sky don’t give Everton any love or whatever but the fact that richarlison was brought down as he’s about to score and that manc cunt hasn’t even said anything about it being a red card makes me more angry than actually losing this game
WATCH: Richarlison wins a penalty that Sigurdsson proceeds to miss with Ederson saving easily. Man City still lead 2-0.

The fact that, that wasn’t even considered a red card was ridiculous. Richarlison was in scoring position against the final defender. Have seen PLENTY OF THOSE FOULS turn into RED CARDS. @Everton @premierleague #MCIEVE

I hate when Richarlison resorts to crap like this. Penalty to Everton. He's acting like Dias tried to murder him. #MCIEVE
Ruben Dias booked for bringing Richarlison down as Everton get a penalty, although Ederson may have been more responsible. Sigurdsson steps up and SAVED

Richarlison picks up a very early booking

Quite harsh, that

https://t.co/eE8ifTb5CL
#EFC seem to have two very different formations when in and out of possession

When City have the ball it looks like a 4-4-1-1, but when Everton win it Richarlison moves much further up and more central
#Everton: Pickford; Holgate, Keane, Godfrey, Digne; Davies, Allan, Doucoure; Sigurdsson; Richarlison e Calvert-Lewin.
@Everton How I see our formation when you print the line up like this....

Pickford
Holgate Digne Doucoure Godfrey

@hummel1923 @Everton @ManCity 1-0 to the blues 🤞
@FPL_MY Mancheste city 3-1 everton (richarlison)
@FPL_MY Manchester City 1 - 1 Everton (Richarlison)
@FPL_MY Man City 1-1 Everton (Richarlison)

@FPL_Salah Nacho to Richarlison, double down on Everton Or maybe firmino or werner for DCL.
@hummel1923 @Everton @ManCity 1 nil to the black and oranges. Richarlison to score COYB
@HavertzBall Periera situation is similar to Diego Jota of Liverpool. Surround him with quality players and he'll turn gold. in my opinion, I think he is better than Richarlison of Everton.
