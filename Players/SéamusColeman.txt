Not many professional footballers achieve the status of club #legend as @FAIreland #captain @seamiecoleman23 has done at @Everton.

Carlo Ancelotti has revealed – via the Liverpool Echo – that he will hold talks with Marcel Brands early next week over handing Everton captain Seamus Coleman a new contract.
Fun fact: The LOI may be a merry-go-round for players but the second and third longest serving EPL players came from it:

Séamus Coleman (joined Everton from Sligo Rovers in January 2009)

Kevin Long (joined Burnley from Cork City in January 2010)

@JoeSchait @rogbennett It's incredibly rare. You think of Seamus Coleman as an Everton lifer, but he was signed from Sligo Rovers

Seamus Coleman could today make his 300th PL appearance for Everton. Willie McStay's recommendation convinced David Moyes to take a £60k punt in January 2009. Here, Willie details the weeks leading up to his move, including a trial with Celtic 👇

Lucas Digne starting today (he was on pre-match media duties) but the question is: how many defenders will be joining him in the XI?

Kyle John has also travelled with the Everton squad today given Seamus Coleman's absence
Great piece by @gcooney93 on Seamus Coleman. 
https://t.co/4VNEp7OUWQ
A lot has been made of the absence of James Rodriguez today (👀), but #EFC being without Seamus Coleman in their current formation will be another big struggle

Me, @philkecho and @CBeesleyEcho have all tried to predict the lineup 👇

A great read for any Evertonian

Soccer 6 team news: Everton playmaker James Rodriguez will not be fit as he continues to be sidelined by a persistent calf problem. Captain Seamus Coleman is also out after sustaining a knock against Wolves in midweek.

Great to see @gcooney93 turn his pen to Séamus Coleman. Unlike many in this Everton squad, the man from Donegal’s attitude and commitment has always been beyond reproach. https://t.co/hNpleWSPiz
The Ireland international has led the way once again this season for Everton. https://t.co/n9jr4ogxTX
Piece on Seamus Coleman, written, eh, further ahead of his 300th Premier League appearance than planned
