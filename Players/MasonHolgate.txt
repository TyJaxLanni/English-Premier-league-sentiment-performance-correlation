Carlo has done an awful job at Everton .. Leeds have finished above them. How Mason holgate plays in the premiership Iâ€™ll never understand.
@Everton @MrAncelotti We need to ask Michael Keane and Mason Holgate if they think they are good enough to don the Blue next season. I can't criticise just based on one game but this season, we have been abysmal at home and our defence shaky because Keane, Holgate and Mina dont bring the goods!

Iâ€™ll always support any Everton player. But itâ€™s impossible weâ€™ll see Mason Holgate in an Everton shirt ever again. Not good enough.
[71â€™] Sergio AgÃ¼ero with the goal. Mason Holgate gave him his sign off present.

The quicker Mason Holgate never plays in an Everton shirt again the betterðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©
Mason Holgate needs a summer training camp with the Everton u7s to learn footy again
@GNev2 got it spot on there. Everton dont have a good enough midfield to play through the centre. No wingers on the pitch our best hope is a fuckin long ball. Be assed with this. Ohhh and I fuckin hate Mason Holgate the gobshite #efc
Yellow card for Mason Holgate now,

Everton warned that selling Mason Holgate this summer would be a "shortsighted" transfer decision
