James Rodriguez joining Everton: 2.5 million likes

Chelsea winning the Champions League: 1.9 million likes

Everton is the biggest blue club in England. James is bigger than Chelsea. https://t.co/MwfNB53uod
7. Rodriguez ‚û°Ô∏è Richarlison ‚û°Ô∏è Calvert-Lewin (EVE vs WBA, GW2)

Remember how exciting Everton were at the beginning of the season? I love this dinked ball from James, and Richarlison does well with the volleyed assist.

We are not privileged to have him. We aren't lucky to have such a talent. We are not blessed or any other nonsense I've read. He is all of the above getting paid to play. He isn't arsed so why should we be. Get rid
@Everton Mad that Allardyce took us from 13th to 8th in 6 months, with Walcott, a 33yr old Wayne Rooney and Morgan Schneiderlin. Ancelotti took us from 1st to 10th in 6 months with James Rodriguez &amp; Richarlison
Fitting that James Rodriguez didn't turn up to Everton's final game because he largely doesn't turn up over the course of a full season anyway. 

Expensive mistake. Still, they did win the league after 5 games I suppose.
@Stevie_c_94 @adamrowecomedy They finished 2 positions behind their usual 8th after bringing in the likes of James Rodriguez and broke our defence into pieces. If you don't believe in karma, just watch Everton.

James Rodriguez has played 320 games since 2006. An average of 21.3 games a year. He's played 23 so far for Everton.

He might be injury prone, or he might be a bit of a soft shite, but he's been no different throughout his career. Carlo knew what he was getting. #efc

@BenDinnery Hello Ben, this might be an easy one for you.... James Rodriguez... did he make a positive impact to Everton, considering his multiple injuries? Salary: cost per injury
LOOOOOL Blues are crying in the replies 

James Rodriguez doesn‚Äôt rate Everton üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ https://t.co/TEto8jpQGs
James Rodriguez:
2X La Liga
2X UCL
2X Bundesliga
Fifa World Cup Golden Boot Winner
Puskas Award
La Liga best midfielder award.

If you want us to win trophies, get behind James. He‚Äôs not perfect but if he was he wouldn‚Äôt be at Everton if we‚Äôre being honest...
Soccer 6 team news: Everton playmaker James Rodriguez will not be fit as he continues to be sidelined by a persistent calf problem. Captain Seamus Coleman is also out after sustaining a knock against Wolves in midweek.
People telling James Rodriguez not to come back to Everton because he‚Äôs not fit and he‚Äôs gone back to Columbia to see his family. Some of our fans are proper spas
James Rodriguez delivers a "thumbs up" message as he flies back to Colombia ahead of Everton's last game of the season

Be interesting to see how many Colombia games James Rodriguez will play in #Everton
Fabian Delph has been at Everton 2 years and he‚Äôs played 4 more games in those 2 years than James Rodriguez has this season. Any more uproar about Delph being injured or we just focusing on the fella who the club have told to go home to see his daughter and recover from injury.
I have been watching football for 11-12 years and I can safely say that off the top of my head James Rodriguez is comfortably the best player I‚Äôve seen at Everton and they all hate himüò≠üò≠üò≠ https://t.co/YQ5CzQGArT

@JLPLopes10 @brundellfilimou @Everton @aftgomes Lmao the "Icelandic Fraud" has 7x more open play assists this season than James Rodr√≠guez &amp; has CARRIED Everton. https://t.co/ze4mbIfMlv
So (if I get it right again!) Everton will lose Moise Kean &amp; James Rodriguez this summer. Goals and creatively are therefore required in abundance this summer.
Everton da's militia vs other Evertonians over James Rodriguez https://t.co/4zninLPNlD
Everton are supporting the British army and orange order. 
James Rodriguez is a joke.
We need a striker who'll score from 20 yards.

Our fans are actual dickheads, it's not even 7 am and I'm reading this shite. Off to shampoo the garden fence all day
Can't believe tomorrow is the last Everton game of the season. And then later this week I'll be on a plane to get out of town like James Rodriguez üòÇ
