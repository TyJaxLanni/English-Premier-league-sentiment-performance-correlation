Would do you make of this Gunners Family?
Alex Iwobi desperate to 'win more trophies' during his time at Everton

Alex Iwobi joined Everton in 2019 after starting his career at Arsenal, making his Gunners debut aged 19. Since then the versatile 25-year https://t.co/M8AZiYIyZQ https://t.co/a1k1vmNuTt
Hello @Everton are we sending players like Mason Holgate, Andre Gomes, Alex Iwobi, Bernard and Johnjoe Kenny to Cowdenbeath? Thanks.
Arsenal surely bad in selling players.

The only good deal whenever we sold player was Alex Iwobi to Everton for â‚¬30.4 million. https://t.co/g9ALqcBgMd
"And now for the mighty blues of Everton, we line up as follows...number 17 Alex Iwobi"

@SecretPrem Walcott didn't fit at Everton takes 50% wage cut and excelled at Southampton.
Iwobi to Palace with Eze injured and Zaha off to Germany would an ideal fit for Â£15m and 50k/wk which Parish could well afford once Zaha is gone. Back to the Big Smoke would suit Alex 100%. Up to MB now
If Everton sell Alex Iwobi they have identified Bayer Leverkusen duo Leon Bailey and Moussa Diaby as possible replacements. | #EFC https://t.co/guFQbU5zN0 https://t.co/VsnkvV2sQ6
Weâ€™ll give them Â£35m plus Alex Iwobi ðŸ˜‰ https://t.co/E8LnpYcLU4
ðŸ”µJames Rodriguez commitment
ðŸ”µJean-Philippe Gbamin return

@Thesaint0104 @maverickLXXXIII @City_Xtra Itâ€™s not like Everton are poor, they spend loads. Pep would spend it on better players than Davy Klassen, Andre Gomes, Alex Iwobi, Michael Keane and Gylfi Sigurdsson, for sure.
Everton will entertain offers for Alex Iwobi. | #EFC https://t.co/GKpR8h93Ec
If Sheffield United payed Â£25m for Rhian Brewster and Everton payed Â£40m for Alex Iwobi, Joe Willock must be at least Â£45m+Â£1....Nketiah Â£30m+Â£1, Maitland Niles Â£25m+Â£1
@Everton @MrAncelotti Some people might not agree with me but get the paper out and resign Duncan Ferguson on the lifetime deal.
With our former Legend, Tom Davies, and Alex iwobi, we will win the treble!
Alex Iwobi &amp; Everton finish the season in 10th place https://t.co/wKulXz3OQP
