Number 1 replace Iwobi. 
Number 2 replace Michael Keane. 
Number 3 replace Andre Gomes. 
Everton still have a good side, like bit of complacency from Spurs or Arsenal and you're in top 6. https://t.co/rJvC4EDmrM
Just a quiet holiday near home for Everton‚Äôs Michael Keane, then? üëÄ https://t.co/YqfrzsfZNQ
Michael Keane Must Use England Snub as Everton Motivation https://t.co/t9cdSKndI3
@Thesaint0104 @maverickLXXXIII @City_Xtra It‚Äôs not like Everton are poor, they spend loads. Pep would spend it on better players than Davy Klassen, Andre Gomes, Alex Iwobi, Michael Keane and Gylfi Sigurdsson, for sure.
The highest Everton player on this doesn't even make the top 50.

It's Michael Keane. Michael bloody Keane. https://t.co/VKkcuZwoAQ
@joelitt78828048 @HeythamSaja Michael Keane is dog shit here as everton fan
@Everton @JPickford1 @CalvertLewin14 @BenG0dfrey @England Can someone in the know explain to me what Michael Keane has done wrong? He was well in the squad a few months ago?
@sadleao @England Idk why Everton keep adding chocolate sprinkles on shit which is Michael Keane and Sigurdsson , i swear we can get Prime Messi , CR7 , Maldini and Ronaldinho we still finished 10th because those two frauds are in our club
Ben Godfrey joins Jordan Pickford and Dominic Calvert-Lewin in provisional England squad for Euro 2020, but Michael Keane misses out.

@SkyFantasyFooty @Jamesmacca1996 This is incorrect. Only the first conceded is a ‚Äúfreebie‚Äù. See Michael Keane who got -4 for conceding 5 for Everton today.  

If it were -1 for 3 goals the rule would be from the 3rd goal onwards not the 2nd. 

So Leicester defenders should have got -3 for conceding 4.
@Everton @MrAncelotti We need to ask Michael Keane and Mason Holgate if they think they are good enough to don the Blue next season. I can't criticise just based on one game but this season, we have been abysmal at home and our defence shaky because Keane, Holgate and Mina dont bring the goods!
@Everton Embarrassing, no fight or urgency again. I don't want to see Michael Keane or Holgate in the squad next year, but a massive clear out is needed anyway, and has been for a few years. I'd only keep about 5 of this squad, the rest can fuckoff to the Championship!!!
@Everton var are a joke. sigurdsson is a joke. michael keane and mason holgate get your fucking act together. everton wake up.
@Everton Keep playing michael keane you idiots
Never seen anyone want European football less than Michael Keane.

@michaelkeane04 @EuropaLeague @Everton
Hope we dont see Michael keane in an Everton shirt again. And about 5 or 6 others on that pitch
Michael Keane with a very ‚Äòlast day of the season‚Äô dribble out the back like a dickhead attempt. Everton ü•¥ https://t.co/MhfBgYxXzi
@Everton Michael Keane‚Äôs terrible. Doesn‚Äôt close down for the first goal and then gives the ball away for the second. Is he playing for Everton or Man City?
2-0

Michael Keane thinking he's Beckenbauer, loses the ball in midfield and Jesus scores. So poor

#UHTPodcast #EFC #COYB #Everton
@AthersBFC Not bad Joe although do you not think Michael Keane deserves a chance from Everton? Ever present in their team and has had a good season. I'd take him over Ming's imo
