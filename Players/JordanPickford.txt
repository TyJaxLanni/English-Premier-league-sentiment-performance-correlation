@TheAthleticUK Jordan Pickford for the second half of the season has been probably one of Everton‚Äôs best players who has been let down from shoddy defending by those in front of him. Deserves to be starting and surely people can‚Äôt think Henderson is any better
Jordan Pickford. Actually think Pickford has had a good season for Everton and has been less error prone. I don‚Äôt rate Henderson as much as the media and some people do, struggles badly to command his area. https://t.co/cts8RY5KGB
There were question marks over Jordan Pickford's position as England's - and Everton's - number 1.

Not anymore. https://t.co/1Eq4iEnoV7

Even Slovenia and Poland have Oblak (Atletico Madrid) and Szczƒôsny(Juventus) respectively

And then we have England with Jordan fucking Pickford(Everton) üò≠
Everton's Jordan Pickford will be undisputed first-choice keeper... ü§î So Dean Henderson doesn't get a consideration?

Pickford reamins Southgate's number one between the posts. The 27-year-old has seldom let his country down in the past, and his distribution sets him apart from his nearest rivals for a starting place. https://t.co/7INTXnjt0z

Everton and Jordan Pickford #Karma #LFC #YNWA
@ketaminedrams Remember Everton top? Virgil Van Dijk's public funeral? The calls for Jordan Pickford to get taken to a CIA blacksite in Algeria? Mourinho beating United 6-1 at Old Trafford? Southampton looking handy? All for nothing. Tears in rain
Jordan Pickford comfortably Everton's best player in a 5-0 defeat. That tells you everything you need to know sadly

A sorry end to the season. Just desperate.
Positives in the season, Ben Godfrey and Jordan Pickford post his ‚Äúinjury‚Äù, and that‚Äôs it #Everton
Jordan Pickford has played well and we have lost 5-0. A total lack of interest by pretty much everyone else. Embarrassing  #EFC
Omnishambles, Everton.

I'd keep Lucas Digne, Ben Godfrey and Jordan Pickford and bin off the rest.
Another big save from Jordan Pickford.
