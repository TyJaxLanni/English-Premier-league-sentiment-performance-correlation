For context one manager has Thiago Silva, Mason Mount, Havertz, Kante.. etc. 

The other manager has Sigurdsson, Gomes, Fabian Delph, Iwobi, Bernard,  Josh King a few prime examples.

Now tell me why it can’t be Everton?
Sheff United are interested in taking Fabian Delph from Everton. The fee will be nominal. Only issue is wages as Everton pay him currently circa £80k per week. Sheff Utd wage structure wouldn’t accommodate. Delph prefers Leeds but Biesla has no interest due to his injury record.
@John_Gaskell @Everton Stop Press: Fabian Delph to Captain the Club for 21/22 Season. A Club spokesman said "He'll be like a new signing" #EFC
No Fabian Delph in the squad either

Everton name eight subs, including two goalkeepers
Fabian Delph has been at Everton 2 years and he’s played 4 more games in those 2 years than James Rodriguez has this season. Any more uproar about Delph being injured or we just focusing on the fella who the club have told to go home to see his daughter and recover from injury.
