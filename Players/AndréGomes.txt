@KevLongSZN Everton to challenge for top 4 and finish 2nd or 3rd!
A wild shout but I believe The Don Carlo Ancelloti will shack things up and Everton( If we sell Andre Gomes the snail and Build around Delph as the main player) we will be a very dangerous side to play against https://t.co/gi4r2NjxVo
From Arouna Kone to Andre Gomes..

Number 1 replace Iwobi. 
Number 2 replace Michael Keane. 
Number 3 replace Andre Gomes. 
Everton still have a good side, like bit of complacency from Spurs or Arsenal and you're in top 6. https://t.co/rJvC4EDmrM

Hello @Everton are we sending players like Mason Holgate, Andre Gomes, Alex Iwobi, Bernard and Johnjoe Kenny to Cowdenbeath? Thanks.
Everton mentality:

⁃Loan Andre Gomes from Barcelona - this lad is gunna be class.
⁃Buy him on a permanent deal - amazing best signing of the summer.
⁃Takes part in a hug-a-thon and is generally class with the fans - he gets the club this lad. 1/2
@Thesaint0104 @maverickLXXXIII @City_Xtra It’s not like Everton are poor, they spend loads. Pep would spend it on better players than Davy Klassen, Andre Gomes, Alex Iwobi, Michael Keane and Gylfi Sigurdsson, for sure.
Give us Andre Gomes @Everton
@Everton @England @BenG0dfrey When you guys transfer listing Sigurdsson , Keane , Iwobi , Bernard , Delph and Andre Gomes ? Please update us
@danielvane @Everton Just a young Andre Gomes !

Everton midfielder Andre Gomes addresses inconsistent campaign https://t.co/2OWhSe1JGM #football #news #sport https://t.co/BtPjdjYQCy
Everton had a strong start to the season and one of the main reason for that was it's mid-field of Andre Gomes, Allan and Doucoure. Gomes is an essential player for Everton and he needs to have more game time next season.

@kioskmongoo @AYYBREVES @barcacentre Andre Gomes was a beast before coming to Barcelona. Even at Everton he is great. It's just psychology. Couldn't handle the authority of superstars
Everton is ran like shite I’d happily finish 15th next year not buy one player but it means we get rid of the dead wood I just don’t understand why we can’t fuck the likes of Andre gomes, sigurdson and iwobi off
What a time to be alive this might be the last time we see Andre gomes play for Everton
This Everton team is fucking embarrassing, so many players need to be fucked off, that’s including the likes of Andre gomes, everyone needs to fuck off their weird love affairs for players like him they’re not good enough.
