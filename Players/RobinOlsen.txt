..uncomfortable when he had to cover for Allan during Allan's absence. But still a very decent signing.

James Rodríguez - 7/10
- Levels above the players alongside him. Unlucky with the number of injuries he had.

Robin Olsen (loan) - 5/10
- I once joked that Everton bought.. https://t.co/TDcbweS3Cd
Robin Olsen | Club ‘hope’ Everton will decide to sign player – Toffees have not given ‘signals in that direction’ yet. 

Getting to the stage maybe a ridiculous low offer is worth a swirl.
