Stop now! shouldn’t a kopite be carrying that @JHenderson @CalvertLewin14 😁 https://t.co/2UbPLlwwIc
@RunReissRun Yeah. Even Everton bought starters.. 
James Allan Doucoure Godfrey..
@TheFornalsWay @Jackcoyi Everton still made decent transfers, Godfrey, Allan and Doucoure have all been solid for them this season. Soucek was a class signing and we’re lucky that he brought in Coufal too. Benrahma did pretty good and Bowen’s been good as well. But the difference between us and Everton..
@MightyBluesYT Ffs. Will ppl stop drooling over this clubs recruitment that clubs recruitment. They're a Championship side at best and will be again in 22/23. Everton last 4 seasons. Pickford Richarlison  Godfrey Nkounkou Small Allan Rodriguez DCL Davies Mina Digne Branthwaite etc Not too bad.
If Everton bring in 3/4 new faces for 1st 11 who survives the chop ? For me Pickford Godfrey digne Allan douc Richie James dcl ? Few of these not void of criticism either
If Ben Godfrey or Allan aren’t your favourite Everton players after this season something is wrong https://t.co/LHLSvrXx9o
https://t.co/KhVxNtbsz2

@everton 

Loads of nice signed &amp; framed shirts all in stock at £149 each.

Richarlison, Calvert Lewin, Allan, Godfrey etc https://t.co/RAtJ9y1Riu
@Tobiloba_O Who did Everton apart from Doucoure, Allan and Rodriguez? Average players
@Allan_OM13 @_BeFoot Everton
@PrinceChrisMUFC @awwalkhan49 Everton - Pickford, Mina, James, Allan, Doucoure are all key players
@EduardoHagn Garlick's job description is different. I don't understand why he's brought up here. Considering xhaka's 29 almost and this is a Covid affected market, I think it's very difficult to fetch higher fee. Look at Allan who joined Everton for somewhere around 15mill
..uncomfortable when he had to cover for Allan during Allan's absence. But still a very decent signing.

James Rodríguez - 7/10
- Levels above the players alongside him. Unlucky with the number of injuries he had.

Robin Olsen (loan) - 5/10
- I once joked that Everton bought.. https://t.co/TDcbweS3Cd
"I hope to stay for many years. I still haven’t had that feeling of the fans in a full Goodison Park but I’ve received a lot of messages congratulating me on my first season in an Everton shirt. I hope to repay them &amp; leave an important legacy at the Club" - Allan
@Korab83883688 @rocksteady147 @Billsofficial @ChiefOnyedika @AFTVMedia Definitely isn’t playing over Tielemans or Ndidi definitely isn’t playing over Doucoure and Allan at Everton doesn’t play over Rice or Soucek at West Ham isn’t better than McGinn at Villa or Bissouma at Brighton wouldn’t play at Leeds
@LivEchoEFC James and Allan have not lived up to expectations. I  think James will not stay because of his weaknesses but Allan could remain if Everton are able to become a team that can press more assertively by introducing pace and power on both wings and more dominance in defence.
@allanholloway @aspitweets Many thanks Allan..I know Everton weekes scored centuries in 5 successive innings but are Fingleton and Rahul Dravid the only 2 to do it in four?  @SanjayS00663282 @McLovinstatto
@holroyd_ryan The four signings carlo was part of(Godfrey,Allan,doucoure and James) have kicked us on,give him 4 more picks,and we don’t improve I’ll tend to agree wit u. Carlo ain’t the problem at Everton.

@SebSB Everton have 5 very good players: DCL, Richarlison, Allan, James and Digne (he’s good enough for France). They played together 7 times in the league. Everton we’re 5-1-1.
Allan x @b_10duarte x @richarlison97 

🇧🇷🙌 https://t.co/1bipJH0rbv
Allan and James have improved them, but too often #EFC have tried to solve today's problems with yesterday's remedies.

More signings like Calvert-Lewin and Godfrey - young, hungry, everything to prove - need to be the blueprint now.

A lot to ask I know.
@ImohUmoren @alitweedale A journalist should have known that, thing is they know these things cuz. But saying the truth won’t bring clicks uno. There’s zero coverage of Ancelottis job at Everton despite getting James, Allan, Docoure. Zero coverage of Poch bottling league 1.

Is Mourinho the only manager?
@fedginator 100%, said Everton last summer before they signed Allan.
@spuddy1878 @MightyBluesYT Good player. Aggressive, ability to switch play either side. Plays 6 role well. Main issue is Allan, Davies, Gbamin, Delph can all do that role currently. Everton haven't got another player that replicates Doucoure. Would look at another midfield if Delph, Davies &amp; Gomes leave

@IceBergHojbjerg @TransferNewsCen Again, the only reason spurs are above Everton is Kane realistically, son is pretty good but when Kane leaves spurs are in a shit state. 
Digne
Godfrey
Allan
Richarlison
Dcl (when Kane goes) 

Would all get in spurs starting 11 as it is now.
@allan_howe Everton as he wasn't used to working with such poor players! 😂 (2/2)
I know we don;'t need reminding, but articles like this confirm how lucky we are with Bielsa! It's full of excuses ("don't have the players) &amp; one cure ("buy more") that Bielsa would never use. He just makes the players better. I love him #lufc 

https://t.co/zESR9FllJG
@Ra_mi34 It’s the PSG price tag. Napoli did the same with Allan. They asked 100M to PSG. He left for 25 to Everton 😂

@taylor_davies77 Everton need to sign him he’s a leader and has been at the age of 20 he’s still young perfect box to box next to either Allan or a doucoure depending on system or injuries and we need a leader and captain in this team next season to build an exciting young team around
Manchester City half-spaces mastery v. Everton [Tactical thread] 👇👇

◉ Inverted FB/ Zinchenko ready to receive+ to attract Allan taking him out from HS City wants to attack 
◉ Foden more inside before making a run in that HS
◉ Sterling pace is vital to finish the sequence https://t.co/0Kmb6Q0W3i
@toonlad9 If we got a takeover and Rafa came in and the money was there we could attract a lot of players if the club can prove there’s a project there while offering them big wages, similar to Everton signing Allan and James
@misterglenbaker @ASeymour1878 @Everton @MrAncelotti Not quite as simple as that...evertonians can see an improvement under CA. His signings look class; Allan, James, Godfrey. He brings in another 3 players of that quality this summer and next season should get very interesting

One of the reason

Why Everton flopped

Even after signing Allan,James,Doucoure

Because they have Sad Guru as their fan

Everton signing Ben Godfrey (amazing), Allan (underrated), Docoure (solid) and James (hibernating) in one window and then signing Josh fucking King (????????????) in the next will never not be hilarious https://t.co/xMZ1wogM79
@Everton_Dad @barry_sherlock Doucoure can’t pass and his touch is terrible really I would have him as backup he’s not good enough but Allan needs a play maker around him and 1 more midfielder
@barry_sherlock @Everton_Dad I’ve been getting the impression with ALLAN over the last few games that he’s getting frustrated with the lack of quality around him and is trying to hard to drive us forward on his own. Don’t think he’s ever played with such snails who are slow and movement is none existent
@Everton_Dad Well there is that... wasn’t on his own yesterday?!? Allan was just as culpable tbqhwy.
@barry_sherlock We need to get Doucoure learning how to pass a ball 5 yards before worrying about Allan 🤦🏻‍♂️

@ki557_ @jamie_byrom @ResilientOne6 @GGenaral5 @LeeGunner82 Everton Literally have a better midfield we have fucking Elneny plzzzz stop. They have Allan, James, Docure (who arsenal fans went crazy), Sigurdson. We have Elneny.
@blekhimenachi @Gooner_Original @Faaabianskiii So both are quality players? Then what happen to Everton this season then when they have brought in James &amp; Allan. Why Ancelotti finish below Arteta then? Why Arteta get the stick but Ancelotti didn’t when Ancelotti supposed to be the better manager?
I'm sorry but Allan looking good in the kit... does not make me feel better on how poor Everton have been.
@Faaabianskiii @IngGooner Agree on that. Given the players Everton have signed for Ancelotti he should have done a lot better; new midfielders like Allan, Doucoure and winger Rodriguez bought at Ancelotti’s expense. Yet, they still underperformed this season.
Everton players end of season ratings

@UTD_Bunny For Everton I would say Pickford... DCL is dependent on others supply unlike other top strikers who create chances for themselves... Pickford has been great specially in 2nd half and defense in front of him is not great. Both Allan nd docouraye were injured for significant part
Everton had a strong start to the season and one of the main reason for that was it's mid-field of Andre Gomes, Allan and Doucoure. Gomes is an essential player for Everton and he needs to have more game time next season.
#EFC #UTFT #COYB https://t.co/rpsDS7kpRz
The only way Everton do anything next season is if we fill these blanks 

Pickford

Blank (trippier) 
Godfrey
Blank (koulibally)
Digne

Allan
Doucoure
Blank (Berge)

Richarlison
Blank (zaha) or (coutinho) 

Calvert-lewin
my god this obsession, allan, james rodriguez left club with european football to join everton. reguilon left real and plays in a btec euro Cup https://t.co/Q6juDhjhQ4
@QuiltyEfc 👏👏👏 Well said 👏👏👏
Here we go again... A MASSIVE clear out is needed ...
Pickford Godfrey Allan Mina Digne Doucouré James (by skin of teeth 
DCL .. The rest... @Everton 
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ ...A bloody Joke
@CuthsSt You musnt know Richarlison then m8, that DCL aload of shite aswel. Docoure wow💩💩💩 😂😂😂😂 Coleman too. Havent you seen Lee Catamole in the Center midfield also?? Amean Allan😂😂😂 Everton fc, the peoples club though arent you geezer🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 least you got no1 on the chart
@LivEchoEFC Mina injured too much throughout his Everton career to date, bring koulibaily in. Iwobi, Bernard, delph, Gomes, kean, all have to be sold, possibly sigurdsson and holgate also. Need a replacement for gana, Allan is more comfortable ahead of cdm.
Everton have a good foundation of Digne, Godfrey, Allan, James &amp; DCL. Once they add real first team members they’ll be a threat to everyone.
Funny how @Everton seasons goes unnoticed imagine buying James doucoure and Allan for that money to come 10th😂😂😂 joke of a club
While I’m talking ball:

- Ancelotti’s Everton really signed James and Allan and finished 10th 
- Lille and Atletico 👏🏻
- Kane will go Citeh
- West Ham will be a problem in UEL
- Lewa and Suarez. Still elite.
- Reckon France are winning the Euros
- Lamela for goal of the season
For the next transfers windows I want us to sign more determined hard working players like Godfrey and Allan. Get the old Everton identity back. Sick of Gylfi Gomes type players
Godfrey was player of the season by far for me, levels of commitment and willingness to do anything asked of him, true to the @Everton mould. Davies had a better season than most give him credit for, stepped up with Allan and Doucouré were injured, can tell he wants to improve -&gt;
I want this to be Everton squad next season including youth players and new signings  
Pickford 
Mina 
Godfrey 
Allan 
Rodriguez 
Richy 
Doucoure 
Digne 
John 
Whittaker 
DCL 
Emerson 
Lozano
Koulibaly 
Bailey 
Sarr 
Pereira
Leao
Rabiot 
New GK 
Simms 
Nkounkou
Gbamin
Everton needs to fire carlo let allan james kean coleman holgate gabin leave the club get some young players and start from scratch
@FinKitch Brands is a great negotiator, just look at the prices he's paid for Allan,Doucoure,Rodriguez etc. We have Ancelotti and that is still a huge pull and we are Everton Football Club, a massive club who's underachieved for far too long,players will come for the chance of first team
Everton players to keep:

Pickford
Digne
Mina
Godfrey
Allan
Rodriguez
Doucoure
Richarlison
DCL

The rest can all fuck off.

Huge rebuild required this summer, don’t be surprised if Ancelotti jumps ship either.
Allan is a holding midfielder who isn’t tall, quick, strong, agile, technically gifted, strong in a tackle, good in the air, capable of playing a diagonal, or able to play a pass through the lines. So why are Everton paying him 120k a week?
My Everton end of season Grade: D-
The newcomers played very well and there impact was incredibly noticeable ( Godfrey, Allan, James ) but we still Failed on achieving our goal of making Europe and getting a cup trophy.. on to the next #COYB
@Huytontoffee @AidyDews @MrAncelotti @Everton They’ve all give the club profits and allowed us to spend sustainably, I rate Allan and Doucoure as players, but how much of that £42m between the two of them do you think we’d be able to recoup further down the line?
@WattsAthletix @GaryLineker @LCFC @Wesley_Fofanaa Always the same mate. maguire is out, it’s hard for united without him. Oh Leicester don’t look the same without vardy (now fofana), everton not the same team without Allan. Liverpool missing the bear cb on the planet and two of the top ones in the league on top of that. Excuses
@BrainyBrands @Stu17666455 @moseyefc Remain to be convinced. Doucoure Leeds maybe. I just don't think he's good enough on the ball to play for a top club. Don't see Allan at ManU. Arsenal as a bigger shambles as Everton so possibly.
@Toffeebluebloo1 i’d keep allan and doucoure back and push bisouma further up the pitch throw richy on the left and have leon bailey on the right, but knowing everton we won’t sign them two in question
@Everton @MrAncelotti Out:
Richy
Sigurdsson
Iwobi
Gomes 
Allan
Bernard 
Keane
Davies

Keep:
Godfrey
Mina
Ducoure
DCL
Pickford
Coleman

Ancelotti needs better athletes with tougher mindset!
@iamawayrightnow @grandoldteam Really don't understand why everyone loves Allan and Doucoure. Allan is too slow, constantly out of position and just gets ran ragged and Doucoure is one of the worst footballers I've seen at Everton, he's technically dreadful.
Good riddance Everton. Don't want to see a single one of these players Next season besides Godfrey starting and then keep Richarlison, DCL, Allan, Doucoure, Davies, Pickford and James on the bench
@tomosefc @Everton @abdoudoucoure16 Allan does his job??
If his name werent carlo ancelotti 90% of r fans wud want him gone, negative defensive bad strtin 11s n terrible subs, but ur not allowed to say a bad word aba him 🤷‍♂️ couldnt give a shit if he stayed or went, only players id keep is allan n godfrey @Everton
@Everton Our recruitment is shocking, Godfrey has been the best player we’ve signed in years. James doesn’t wanna be there, he was hoping for a good season and a big club would come in for him, Allan and Doucoure haven’t been half the player they were since their injuries
@Everton Allan, Godfrey &amp; Richarlison did well today....full stop....need to build around them....

Boz
Allan’s reaction says it all 😂😂😂 https://t.co/HDdvS6onIq
@emmaowen14 @Everton I’d only be disappointed to see Godfrey and DCL leave to be honest. Maybe Doucoure, Digne and Allan as well.
@Everton Was Allan even playing????????
@Everton Can we sell everyone but dcl Godfrey Allan digne doucoure
@alexbe11 Yep, though the mix of Brands/Carlo signings showed promise until James and Allan broke so...but more Godfrey young/hungry types please Everton!
Fair play to Nkonkou and Allan even at 5-0 down at least trying to do something showing effort. everyone else walking/standing still
Pickford and Godfrey excellent Davies and Allan tried....that's it...a poor poor gutless spineless performance carried out by poor gutless spineless Everton shirt wearers...

Good luck to Marcel Brands. U have about 4 worthy players, thats about it. Im not even having Allan and Doucoure are good enough! Embarrassing end to the season. #MCIEVE @EvertonBlueArmy @Everton @EvertonFutbol @grandoldteam @EvertonNewsFeed
@Everton Sam Allardyce finished 8th with Tosun, Walcott and Niasse But he gets loads of shit and got hounded out the club. We've slipped from 5th to 10th in 10 games with Richarlison, Rodriguez, Allan and co. but everyone loves Carlo. I'm confused. @ToffeeTVEFC @EvertonBlueArmy
Nice to see some Everton fans finally realising how shite Doucoure and Allan are. Been saying that for the majority of the season and had nothing but abuse. We're going to finish 10th and some fans still think the club can't do anything wrong. Pathetic!!!

#MCIEVE #EFC #Everton
Bring in Carlo Ancelloti, bring in Allan, Doucoure, Godfrey, James. All to finish lower in the table than Marco Silva, Ronald Koeman, Roberto Martinez and Big Sam teams at Everton.
Doucoure and Allan today showing why Everton will finish 10th. They’re bang average. Another summer of needing 3 centre midfielders.

Allan - immobile 
Doucoure - technically shite
Everton signing Allan, Doucoure and James and still finishing in there standard mid table position is jokes too...
Wow! The technicalities they go to so that Everton can be disadvantaged is commendable. The officials are definitely the best in the world. Can’t wait to hear why De Bruyne wasn’t carded for Allan challenge. And that’s the least of the lot
@Everton Can we just have pictures of Allan please
@MattJFootball @cibriddon Allan played 30+ games the last eight seasons. Welcome to Everton! 

Squad is terrible. As you just tweeted, we were 2nd at the halfway-ish point.
@Everton Not particularly. Talking points will be why is Allan the only one running, why haven’t we got one right sided player on the pitch, why did me dad make me support you absolute shit show of a club. The usual 💩
Players Everton should keep and sell!
Pickford-keep
Holgate-sell
Keane-sell 
Mina-keep
Godfrey-keep
Digne-keep
Coleman-keep but replace
Davies-keep
Sigurdson-keep
Doucoure-keep
Allan-keep
Calvert Lewin-sell or loan out 
Richarlison-keep

Lol you think players give a singular fuck about Everton Football Club? They’re there for money and the league not because your clubs history is known around the world. You think Allan left Napoli for Everton cos of the “ambition and history”? 😭😭 cucks club. https://t.co/wM6ipe8aUL
@CJacam0 @Everton @aftgomes Very possible. I remember him having a very solid game during the first game at Spurs with Allan and Doucoure
