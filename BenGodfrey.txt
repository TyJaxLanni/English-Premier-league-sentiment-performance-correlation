@GazzyHay @RichyAlde @TranmereRovers Crazy, look at York City and how much they got from the Ben Godfrey deal Norwich to Everton.
If Ben Godfrey gets a chance at the Euro‚Äôs I don‚Äôt see him starting the season at Everton, pray and count your lucky stars he doesn‚Äôt get a sniff.
@Everton @BenG0dfrey @England Sir Ben of Godfrey
@BenStevens12 I want to make it categorically clear, that I hate Man City as well. I hate every single football team in England, including Everton. I only support Ben Godfrey. (Corrected it for you)
@AnfieldOpinion6 No Ben Godfrey
@25April2004 I feel like Aarons is immensely overrated, I wouldn‚Äôt commit more than 25M (or whatever Everton paid for Ben Godfrey). Will look into to Celik though.

Who's you favorite Everton player and why is it Ben Godfrey?

He played in 3rd best defense this season

And 4 players picked ahead of him finished lower than us in table

Conor Coady  Wolves
Ben Godfrey  Everton
Tyrone Mings Aston Villa
Ben White Brighton
You can‚Äôt make it up. Just watched @BBCNWT speak about Ben Godfrey selected for England while showing a clip of him training for Norwich. He‚Äôs been @Everton for a season now dickheads
@Milan_Fanatic Southgate chose defenders who can play in different positions also, Godfrey played left back and right back this year for Everton and sometimes Ben white was in the midfield for Brighton
Trent Alexander-Arnold (included) - Whether he makes the final squad is yet to be decided, but the signs are looking good for TAA. It‚Äôs obvious why he should be in there.

Ben Godfrey (included) - Has almost single-handedly held a shaky Everton defence together this season. https://t.co/fzCwGrh6ks

Zaha will end up at Arsenal/Spurs. I‚Äôm sure Carlo/Brands have learned the lessons from the last 7 years. A different approach is needed with Everton now &amp; Ben Godfrey is the template. Zaha a couple of seasons ago would have been a good signing but not now! #EFC

Happy to see Ben Godfrey in the provisional squad, shows he has impressed this season. I rate him high but don't think he'll make the final cut just now.Really good ball player and has learnt a lot at Everton this season he's also versatile that helps. He has been consistent.

Ben Godfrey is Englands best CB. If he played this season at any half decent team and not piss poor Everton his inclusion would not raise eyebrows.

His talent was spotted by Norwich City where he won the Championship and got a move to Everton.

Chuffed for Ben Godfrey to get recognition for an outstanding debut season. He‚Äôs been brilliant and it‚Äôs great to see. Think he will have an integral role to play at Everton and will lead by example. His commitment and bravery is massive.

If you can attract Ben Godfrey to Everton without Europe, you don't necessarily need European football to convince the right players to join #EFC.

Hungry players with something to prove in his and Calvert-Lewin's mould have to be the blueprint this summer. Not just big names.
@Everton Absolute disgrace, should all be docked pay.... too many cant be arsed that need shifting, get in young hungry quality potential that will run through walls for the club like Ben Godfrey
Nothings gonna change with Everton‚Äôs transfer strategy. We will sign and be stuck with 3/4 other shitehawks on major money contracts this summer. Ben Godfrey type signings are the way forward. Build a team that are hungry and proud to represent the club. I won‚Äôt hold my breath.
Positives in the season, Ben Godfrey and Jordan Pickford post his ‚Äúinjury‚Äù, and that‚Äôs it #Everton

I'd keep Lucas Digne, Ben Godfrey and Jordan Pickford and bin off the rest.

Ben Godfrey makes more forward runs in every game than the rest of the Everton team combined.#EFC #NSNO
Manchester City the Champions ending the season in style 3-0 ahead of Everton and Ederson has saved a penalty from Gylfi Sigurdsson. Kevin De Bruyne, Gabriel Jesus and Phil Foden with the goals. Foden's goal was a beautiful move the touch from him to beat Ben Godfrey was superb.
Even Ben Godfrey is making mistakes now, playing a dreadful pass back to Pickford which he then miscontrols and has to boot out for a throw
