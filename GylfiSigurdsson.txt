Everton Goal of the Season: 2020-21

We‚Äôve picked out our 5 favourites from this campaign - which were yours? #EFC https://t.co/85Z2Luc9KH
@Thesaint0104 @maverickLXXXIII @City_Xtra It‚Äôs not like Everton are poor, they spend loads. Pep would spend it on better players than Davy Klassen, Andre Gomes, Alex Iwobi, Michael Keane and Gylfi Sigurdsson, for sure.
10. #Everton
Best player: Dominic Calvert-Lewin
Player I enjoyed watching: Gylfi Sigurdsson
Positives: Good away record, win at Anfield after 22 years
Negatives: Poor results at Goodison Park, failure to qualify for any European competition
Very telling how Everton can heavily increase your chances of paranoid schizophrenia by the fact an offshoot of the club does great charity work is the reason Gylfi Sigurdsson‚Äôs a crab.
Everton fans on Twitter if they ever say anything bad about Gylfi Sigurdsson https://t.co/bIt4wpFuKv
Good morning to everyone except @Everton and Gylfi Sigurdsson. Man you had 1 jobüòîüìâ
If Everton offer Gylfi Sigurdsson a new  contract I'm going to delete twitter and start running like Forrest Gump..

I can't see how he fits into any identify Carlo is hopefully going to implement going forward.. https://t.co/Iq9jSLfIsl
#MOTD A thumping defeat for Everton at a ground they usually get beaten on. Gylfi Sigurdsson's missed penalty the best they could offer. Looking like many of the players are on the beach already. #EVE
David McGoldrick (Sheffield United)
Fred Onyedinma (Wycombe Wanderers)
Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool)
Sadio Mane (Liverpool)
Leandro Trossard (Brighton &amp; Hove Albion)
Jorginho (Chelsea)
Richarlison x2 (Everton)
Gylfi Sigurdsson x3 (Everton)
Bernard (Everton)
As if I needed another reason to hate Everton hahahahaha. Gylfi Sigurdsson missing a pen to let me down for ¬£780ü§Æ https://t.co/WGBEgeSU0U
Massive shout out to Gylfi Sigurdsson and the entire Everton team for ruining my Sunday ü§òüèª https://t.co/CVX15Q5SjT
Manchester City the Champions ending the season in style 3-0 ahead of Everton and Ederson has saved a penalty from Gylfi Sigurdsson. Kevin De Bruyne, Gabriel Jesus and Phil Foden with the goals. Foden's goal was a beautiful move the touch from him to beat Ben Godfrey was superb.
Hopefully that‚Äôs the last time we ever see Gylfi Sigurdsson in an Everton shirt !!! üôèüèªü§ûüèª #MCIEVE
Abdoulaye Doucour√© And Gylfi Sigurdsson make way for the frightening Bernard and Iwobi, making Dias quake in his boots.
And off he goes, I pray and Ill light as many candles as possible that that is the last I ever see of Gylfi Sigurdsson in a Everton jersey.
The sooner Gylfi Sigurdsson leaves this club the sooner I can get excited about its future again. It‚Äôs got fuck all to do with that penalty too. If anything, I wanted him to take it after the derby. But I hope and pray that‚Äôs the last I‚Äôve seen of him in an Everton shirt.
Really hope I never seen Gylfi Sigurdsson play for Everton again.
This one will upset the da‚Äôs

If you‚Äôre making a list of Everton‚Äôs top 5 best players this season, Gylfi Sigurdsson has to be on it.
I‚Äôm looking forward to a nice break from Everton and their factory of sadness.

I am not looking forward to another season of watching Gylfi Sigurdsson.
