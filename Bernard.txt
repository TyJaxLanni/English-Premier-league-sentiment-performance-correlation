No way Bernard has gone and confirmed his transfer away from Everton😭 https://t.co/ekl0ghfjyx
@griffwebber @Everton @BenG0dfrey @England Bernard
For context one manager has Thiago Silva, Mason Mount, Havertz, Kante.. etc. 

The other manager has Sigurdsson, Gomes, Fabian Delph, Iwobi, Bernard,  Josh King a few prime examples.

Now tell me why it can’t be Everton?
@billymooreAPBD @Everton Great to see you have Gomes and Bernard numbers on the same shirt! 🤣
https://t.co/aoEqeLmYAh Can't see him getting minutes over Bernard and Iwobi. https://t.co/Z5GP0tzkVz
Hello @Everton are we sending players like Mason Holgate, Andre Gomes, Alex Iwobi, Bernard and Johnjoe Kenny to Cowdenbeath? Thanks.
@Everton @GuiseleyAFC When we going to sell Keane , Sigurdsson , Iwobi , Bernard , Delph and Gomes?
Buendia + Aarons &gt; Everton

Kenny + Iwobi + Bernard + Delph + Tosun &gt; Norwich

I can dream 😩
If Ocampos becomes available then Everton should be all over him. A top player who can do it on both wings and would be a significant upgrade on Bernard/Iwobi https://t.co/XkNnNoZ0YY
@MrEverton1878 Obviously not been listening to Carlo or reading any of Everton press releases. Moshiri has promised £100m + income from sales + release clauses saving £1.5m/ MTH in wages minimum. All things being equal if he only sold Bernard Kenny Kean Delph and Iwobi = min £50m. Nice warchest

@philkecho on how Everton can trim the wage bill this summer🤑

@PaulBrownEFC We @Everton need to offload at least 8 off the payroll asap 
Bernard Delph Bollasie Besic 
Iwobi Tosun Gomez Holgate (Walcott gone) 
I hope and pray the “Pull of Carlo”
can attract top players to sign 🙏
We definitely definitely need a PROVEN Goal Scoring Striker as well as DCL
Go prendre Bernard d'Everton
@Philip98EFC @James1878___ @TheEvertonEnd @Sport_Witness The days of sell on value at Everton are gone. Moshiri saw to that. Look at our wing positions. Zaha is a massive improvement whether you agree or not. Bernard, Iwobi, Anthony Gordon or Wilfred Zaha? No settle in period. No language barrier. Knows the league.
@TLogic1991 Typical Everton absolutely shocking if true, enough of the old, past it, never will be again, why can so many other teams get it so right and we keep absolutely blown it, how many iwobi, Walcott,  Bernard, ,  do we have to buy before you realise it doesnt work

@ShoeyEFC1234 @Everton Bernard?
Everton will place Bernard back on the transfer list this summer after his failed January exit, according to Sky Sports journalist Ben Grounds. https://t.co/Kkz0mfEf8g
@Forever_Everton @EvertonBlueArmy Absolutely spot on - add delph gbamin Bernard kean failure to get a right back etc

Hi @Everton,

Seeing as UEFA can't ban us for FFP because it would punish us Fans, let's pay off the poor excuses that are Delph, Tosun, etc. try and get a bit of dough for Sig, Gomes and Bernard and then just go and splash the cash on whoever Carlo wants.

He who dares, wins 💙

@Everton surely we can swap Bernard or iwobi in a part exchange it just hasn't worked for them
@EfcSl @PaulDahl19 @Everton_Dad Sig is a myth the last 2 seasons. Hasn't had a shot outside the penalty area, has had 3 or 4 pens saved/missed and his dead ball quality is dead shite.

If we can get £5m, I'd take it. Get him off the books. Added with Iwobi, Gomes, Delph plus Bernard &amp; King if not playing.
Next stage of our progression it's so important to get signings right again. You look at the amount Everton have spent on likes of Iwobi, Walcott, Gylfi, Bernard, Gomez, Tosun, Kean to name a few and finish 10th this season. So much money wasted there. We need to box clever #avfc
@LivEchoEFC Mina injured too much throughout his Everton career to date, bring koulibaily in. Iwobi, Bernard, delph, Gomes, kean, all have to be sold, possibly sigurdsson and holgate also. Need a replacement for gana, Allan is more comfortable ahead of cdm.
The following should/will not be at Everton next season:

Besic 
Beningime
Walcot 
Tosun
Olsen 
Coleman
Delph
Sigurdsson 
Iwobi
King
Gomes
Bernard 

There is also an argument for James and one from DCL and Richarlison too.

Moshiri's most important transfer window, again...
Time to get shut of; Iwobi, Bernard, Rodriguez, Gomes, Sigurdsson, Delph. Some are frauds, some are plain shite, they all need to get out of our club. #MCIEVE #Everton
@tomjohno18781 @josh_ingham07 @Everton Yeah Bernard then Iwobi and then Gomes, Holgate and Kean after. 🤞🏻
Everton need to get rid of players that can’t stay healthy. I mean Gabamin, James, Yerry, possibly Gomes too. Players that just aren’t good enough that need to go are Delphi, Iwobi, and possibly Bernard. And Stop playing 4-4-2 diamond. That’s my take.
Davies, Holgate, Bernard can go. Not good enough. @everton need to be more ruthless.
@philkecho Looking forward to tweets like this becoming historic markers of how wank Everton once were Phil. 

"D'you remember that time when we had Iwobi and Bernard coming on?" 😱😱
@griffwebber @Everton Where are all the young players that have done well for the under 21s for the last few seasons ?? Would rather see them get a chance ( iwobi siggi Gomes Bernard) not good enough.. I give up again 🥲🥲
@Everton @MrAncelotti Out:
Richy
Sigurdsson
Iwobi
Gomes 
Allan
Bernard 
Keane
Davies

Keep:
Godfrey
Mina
Ducoure
DCL
Pickford
Coleman

Ancelotti needs better athletes with tougher mindset!
Pep crying over ageuro leaving there , I bet Carlo will be sniffing ket whej Iwobi davies Bernard Siggurdson an Holgate leave Everton
@sterramilk Give her nowt no Everton player had a brew and neither did Bernard... #TeaLadehOwt
Everton players we need to get rid of Holgate, Iwobi, Bernard, Gomes, Siggs, Davis, Delph, we need a top class striker, give DCL/Rich time on the bench, a good quick winger, energy/speedy two new midfielders, a quick right back. Pack the team with energy and speed.

@Everton Holgate Keane @richarlison97 @CalvertLewin14 Davies Iwobi Bernard and Sigurdsson should have played their last games for Everton... Embarrassing
Players who should not play for Everton next season if we want to achieve something:
Holgate 
Delph
Gomes
Iwobi
Bernard
Besic
King
Tosun

Players who should be squad players at best if we want to achieve something:
Coleman 
Keane 
Davies 
Sigurdsson
Massive clear out needed at Everton. I’d get shut of:
 Olsen, Coleman, Delph, Holgate, Mina, Sigurdsson, Iwobi, Gomes, Besic, Bernard &amp; King!

With no Europe - go &amp; buy 2-3 quality young hungry players with energy &amp; pace.

Huge pre-season for Gordon &amp; Simms
@Everton *capitulation. 
Bernard, Iwobi, Gomes, Delph need to be sold asap. Richarlison, Holgate need to smarten up. James? God knows what to do with him!
@Everton We were never going to win this game BUT to finish 10th is a disgraceful performance after a bright start to the season. Home form was dreadful and clearly the “B” team of Sigurdsson, Bernard &amp; Iwobi weren’t good enough to sub in for Rodriguez etc summer clear out needed
@Everton Hopefully now yoh can announce releasing and selling of these players 

Holgate 
Keane 
Gomes 
Iwobi 
Delph 
Bernard 
Sigi
I really hope I never see Delph, iwobi, sigurdson, Bernard in an Everton shirt ever again! So many players vastly overrated players in this squad also

I fucking detest this gutless @Everton side !! No character, no quality ! Absolute fucking disgrace !! Davies, iwobi, siggy, holgate, Gomes, Bernard, Keane I hope I never see you in an Everton shirt again !! 🤮
@win_n10 @Everton @MrAncelotti There’s a massive list to get rid of. Besic, Bolasie, Delph, Iwobi, Holgate, Bernard, Kenny.... Each we get rid off is good work done
Players I don't want to see in an Everton kit next season.

Iwobi
Bernard
Sigurdsson
Gomes
Holgate

We must add pace to the attacking 3rd.
#Everton #efc
My idea of a good Everton summer transfer window:

3 starting XI players and some good youth recruitment ✅

Sigurdsson, Iwobi, Bernard, Delph ❎
I never want to see Bernard and Iwobi in an Everton squad again
Time to clear the house with this lot of chancers @Everton 
Sigurdsson, iwobi, holgate, Bernard, gomes, they have to go blud
Iwobi, Bernard, Holgate, Sigurdsson, Keane in the shop window. Hoping this is the last time we see you in an @everton shirt. Season of disappointment. Massive changes needed in the summer. 10th is not good enough!!!
WTF ARE WE DOING! Passing round the back like we’re 3-0 up. Bernard had the ball plenty of space down the line passed it back! Digne done the same opposite side then snail football round the back 😠
@garywhitta Spare a thought for us Everton fans Gary. Three down and we’ve just brought on Iwobi and Bernard.
Abdoulaye Doucouré And Gylfi Sigurdsson make way for the frightening Bernard and Iwobi, making Dias quake in his boots.
58 | Everton Sub;

OFF - Sigurdsson
ON - Bernard
Sigurdsson makes way for Bernard. 

Everton still trail 3-0.
