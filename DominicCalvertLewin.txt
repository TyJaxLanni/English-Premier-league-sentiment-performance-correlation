Dominic Calvert-Lewin pulled one back for the Toffees. 
It was the first time Burnley had won at Anfield and Goodison Park in the same season. https://t.co/64l9URqAyA
@iambolar Hmmm, na dem Sabi. There are good and cheap players they can replace him with, person like Patson daka of RB Salzburg ( 27 goals and 7 assists in 27 league appearances), Paul onuachu ( With 33 goals in the league; 35 in all competitions). Even Dominic Calvert lewin of Everton.

10. #Everton
Best player: Dominic Calvert-Lewin
Player I enjoyed watching: Gylfi Sigurdsson
Positives: Good away record, win at Anfield after 22 years
Negatives: Poor results at Goodison Park, failure to qualify for any European competition
#fcextratime Should Everton and Chelsea swap Tammy Abraham for Dominic Calvert-Lewin? Perhaps it‚Äôs a good move for all parties involved?

@taytel1705 Feel sorry for Tammy, but he really had no business fully comitting to England yet. Tuchel or not, Still not convinced he would have been on the plane ahead of Everton‚Äôs Dominic-Calvert Lewin.

Ben Godfrey one of three Everton inclusions in England's provisional Euro 2020 squad alongside Jordan Pickford and Dominic Calvert-Lewin. Richly deserved for the defender after an incredible debut season at Goodison Park #EFC

Position: ST
Age: 24
Club: Everton
Caps: 7

This season, DCL was responsible for over a third of shot-shy Everton's Premier League goals, scoring 16 times. His spindly fame means he could make an impactful cameo off the bench - a headed winner maybe? https://t.co/pO02VEDaNk
@TransferNewsCen Chelsea new striker options:
1) Lautaro Martinez ¬£70m Inter
2) Victor Osimhen ¬£50m Napoli
3) Dominic Calvert-Lewin ¬£45m Everton or part/ex Tammy Abraham. 

Thoughts?

PLEASE DONT FORGET......
Thursday afternoon 12:35 start...Everton and England star DOMINIC CALVERT-LEWIN to present trophies for the winners and runners up...
There will be menus for dinner options at reception and timings for entertainment..
We hope to see you all there!
James Rodr√≠guez and Ben Godfrey along with also having Richarlison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin, I really thought that Everton would have been higher up the table and not 10th. Leicester did better than I expected not only finishing 5th but also winning the FA Cup.
Unpopular opinion: Dominic Calvert-Lewin is one of the worst strikers with his feet I‚Äôve ever seen. Were you excited when he was 1 on 1 today? Absolutely unbelievable in the air but maybe the ‚ÄúEverton da‚Äôs‚Äù as he says have a point? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Dominic Calvert-Lewin is played through brilliantly by Sigurdsson and his shot is saved by Ederson. Good forward play that by Everton! #EFC
@hummel1923 @Everton @ManCity 2-0 , Everton to win!  Dominic Calvert Lewin on the scoresheet!
Spurs are currently looking for replacements because of the likeliness 
That Harry Kane will be leaving the club this summer.
One of those players is Everton Striker Dominic Calvert Lewin #Kane
